Privacy Policy for GreenBot
Effective Date: August 13, 2025

Introduction
This Privacy Policy outlines how GreenBot ("the Bot," "we," "us," "our") collects, uses, and stores information when you interact with it on Discord ("the Service"). By using the Bot, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

1. Information We Collect
We collect a limited amount of data necessary for the Bot to function. This data is stored locally on the private server hosting the Bot.

Discord User Information:

User ID and Username: We store your Discord User ID and username to associate you with your command usage, memory files, and suggestions.

User-Provided Content:

Message Content (Memory): When you interact with the Bot (by mentioning it, using !gb, or in DMs), the content of your message is saved to a private text file on the server. This file is associated with your User ID and serves as the Bot's "memory" to provide conversational context.

Media Files: The Bot automatically scans messages for media attachments and URLs (images, GIFs, videos). If a file meets the configured criteria (e.g., valid file type, under 50MB), a copy is downloaded and stored in a local "media pool" on the server.

Suggestions: When you use the !gb suggest command, the content of your suggestion, along with your username and User ID, is posted to a designated channel.

2. How We Use Your Information
The data collected is used exclusively for the following purposes:

To Provide Core Functionality: To generate AI responses, maintain conversational memory, and enable the random media interjection feature.

To Respond to Commands: To execute commands such as !gb health, !gb mem, and !gb img.

For Administration: To allow the Bot Owner to manage the collected media pool via the !gb img commands.

For Logging and Debugging: To ensure the stability and performance of the Bot.

3. Data Storage, Retention, and Security
Storage: All collected data is stored in private files on the server that hosts the Bot. This data is not shared with any third-party services.

Data Retention:

User Memory: Your message history is automatically pruned to a maximum of 300 lines. The oldest messages are deleted as new ones are added.

Media Pool: The media pool is automatically pruned to a maximum of 100 files. The oldest files are deleted as new ones are added.

Security: We take reasonable measures to secure the server and the data stored on it. However, no online service can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

4. Your Rights and Data Control
You have direct control over the primary data you provide to the Bot.

Accessing Your Data: You can view a recent snippet of your stored message history at any time by using the !gb mem show command.

Deleting Your Data: You can permanently delete your entire message history file from the server by using the !gb mem clear command.

Media Removal: If you wish to have a specific image or video you posted removed from the Bot's media pool, please contact the Bot Owner.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any significant changes by posting the new policy in a designated channel within the Discord server.

6. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to make a data-related request, please contact the Bot Owner, whoq, via a direct message or by mentioning them in the server GreenWeb.
