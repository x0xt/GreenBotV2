GreenBot Terms of Service
Last Updated: August 13, 2025

Look, you're not going to read this, and I don't care if you do. But for legal reasons, here's the deal. By using GreenBot ("the Bot"), you agree to the following terms. If you don't agree, get out.

1. Acceptance of Terms
By interacting with the Bot in any way—mentioning it, using its commands, or even thinking about it too hard—you are agreeing to these terms. You acknowledge that the primary purpose of this Bot is to be a chaotic, unhelpful, and sarcastic presence.

2. User Conduct
You agree not to be a complete moron. This includes, but is not limited to:

Asking for instructions on illegal or dangerous activities. The Bot will not help you; it will just mock you for being an idiot.

Spamming commands in a way that annoys everyone. The Bot has rate limits and will insult you if you hit them.

Expecting any form of politeness, empathy, or customer service. You will receive none.

Violation of these terms may result in the Bot ignoring you, insulting you more, or the server owner banning you.

3. Disclaimer of Warranties
The Bot is provided "AS IS," without warranty of any kind. It is probably broken in several ways we haven't discovered yet. We do not guarantee that the Bot will be online, accurate, or not have a complete meltdown.

4. Limitation of Liability
In no event shall the creators of the Bot be liable for any hurt feelings, emotional distress, confusion, or existential dread caused by the Bot's replies. If the Bot insults you, that is a feature, not a bug. That's a "you" problem.

5. Termination
We reserve the right to block any user from interacting with the Bot for any reason, or for no reason at all, especially if you are boring.
